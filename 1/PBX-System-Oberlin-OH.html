<p>Share one telephone number across numerous phones, and respond to calls from any phone. Primary telephone service providers are using details services such as automated number recognition, which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from call switching and will make it much easier to add brand-new services. Cloud phones are hosted in one or more offsite safe information centers.

Because the voice signal is separated into information packages as an IP call, spread over the internet, and reassembled at its location (sort of like a Star Trek transporter), rather than binding a copper peer-to-peer landline circuit, long-distance calls are less costly through VoIP-- another savings point. Rather of using telephone lines, VoIP uses SIP trunks (SIP stands for session initiation procedure).</p>
