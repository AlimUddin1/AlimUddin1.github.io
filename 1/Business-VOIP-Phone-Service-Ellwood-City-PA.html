<p>Softphone replaces the physical PBX to manage the telephone system. Individuals using hosted VoIP phone services need to ensure that the information centers have adequate power, connectivity, and redundancy to supply high accessibility. A hosted VoIP service does not cost thousands of dollars in advance.

<p>VoIP is similar to virtual phone systems; it's a cloud-based technology that transports voice calls over the internet instead of over a conventional wired phone network. Using your business's internet connection to host calls rather than through traditional analog signals, VoIP enables both video and voice chat.
